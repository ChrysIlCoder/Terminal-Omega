# Omega Terminal

Welcome to the **OMEGA TERMINAL**, here you can find informations regarding the anomalies surronding the facility. Here's a quick run through!

## Using the commands

The terminal supports only a limited amount of commands, as this is the ██-Station in the area ██-█
- Random Scp: ```This command gives you access to the information regarding any scp, good and quick information when going around```
- Chi Sono: ```This command tells a bit about the creator of **This Terminal**```
- Cosa Faccio: ```This command tells the skills of the creator of **This Terminal**, this information is out-dated, now he's so much better!```

## The Random SCP Api

The Random SCP api uses the open-source github repository [Scp API](https://github.com/scp-data/scp-api).
For more information, consults the [Docs](https://github.com/scp-data/scp-api/tree/main/docs)
